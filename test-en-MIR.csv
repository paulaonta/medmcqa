Answer 1 is not in accordance with what has been said, this is an unstable patient who has bled a lot, who has a Forrest IIa ulcer with a high risk of rebleeding. Answer 2 speaks of somatostatin, which is used for bleeding due to portal hypertension. 4 will only be considered if bleeding is not controlled endoscopically.

By rule 1 would be easy to eliminate, the treatment of colon cancer is surgical (with neoadjuvant in rectal cancer). If biopsies confirm adenocarcinoma, there is no need to repeat them, since it is necessary to have the complete specimen. Most colon cancer develops on adenomas, so we could eliminate this one. Among the other 2, it is important to know that 5 is correct since they almost always present microsatellite instability even without fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria and have a better prognosis than other poorly differentiated colon cancer.",Medicine,

The patient, due to the mechanism of injury (foot fall), the calcaneal fracture and the neurological symptoms, suggests a low spinal cord injury due to a fracture of the lumbar spine. The injury is not high because he moves his arms. It also does not appear to be a pelvic injury because of the absence of pain on mobilization or palpation. If there is a suspicion of pelvic injury in the primary evaluation of all polytraumatized (ATLS) a spinal exploration should be performed by rotating the spine en bloc to avoid producing more injury. Abdominal palpation is also part of the initial evaluation.

If the patient initially came with a blood gas with a pH of 7.05 and now has the one we are given, we are doing well (although we are not told the time interval between one thing and the other) and, in this case, it could be worthwhile to continue with the same treatment. If nothing has evolved, the clinical picture is the same and the blood gas at the beginning was similar, something should be done (also depending on the patient's baseline status, which they do not tell us either). If we decide to do something, at present we might decide to use ventilation rather than theophylline, although with ""so little"" alteration of pH (and even more so if we think that this is a chronic patient who may have a baseline blood gas similar to the one presented to us) it may seem ""exaggerated"".

The cause is usually a rapidly growing pituitary mass secondary to a vascular event (infarction or hemorrhage). General symptoms may range from vomiting or nausea to meningeal irritation. Compression on the chiasm and optic nerve can cause various campimetric deficits (usually greater bitemporal hemianopsia in the superior quadrants) and decreased visual acuity, even blindness. If the mass grows lateral to the sella turcica it can compress the oculomotor nerves, with the common motor ocular nerve being the most frequently affected, because of its more medial course in the cavernous sinus. The test of choice for the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy is MRI, as CT may not distinguish the region clearly enough to distinguish degenerative or cystic changes from previous bleedings. The finding of erosion of the anterior clinoid processes in the skull CT may support a chronic lesion, which as a result of an acute vascular phenomenon has caused the symptoms. The management of these patients involves strict control of water and electrolyte disturbances and correction of hormonal deficits. In unstable situations as in the case described, with significant visual disturbances, surgical intervention is usually of choice, with transsphenoidal decompression.",Surgery,

Age and sex also point to this possibility. Abrupt unilateral visual loss with pale papillary edema is highly indicative of arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy due to GCA. The ESR is elevated, which further clarifies the diagnosis. We have to quickly start corticosteroid treatment.

Answer 2 is possible because bisphosphonates create mandibular necrosis. 3 seems unlikely to me because the radiotherapy that the patient received would be oriented on the breast and not on the mandible. I rule out number 4, as it is not a case of dental root involvement. 5 is possible; after all, the patient already has bone metastases. So, I hesitate between 2 and 5, which one to choose? I am certainly not sure what a bone sclerosis means on a CT scan, but a bone metastasis would be more destructive than sclerotizing. On the other hand, using reverse psychology, what did the questioner want me to know? That bisphosphonates can create mandibular necrosis? Or that a woman with several bone metastases can have a metastasis also in the mandible? The latter seems too simple, and would make me lean more towards 2, but it's not clear to me.

Multiple inflammatory foci with neutrophils, Mallory's hyaline degeneration and fibrosis around the terminal hepatic venules. Point out the correct answer in this case:",Biopsy should be repeated to see if the changes are diffuse.,Diagnosis is hepatic glycogenosis associated with diabetes.,Histological changes are irreversible and will eventually lead to cirrhosis.,The injury is clearly caused by alcohol despite the patient's refusal.,It is important to reduce weight and adequately control diabetes to avoid the possible development of cirrhosis.,5,single,"The changes described in the question statement correspond to an early precirrhotic situation. Although alcohol is the most frequent toxicant that causes this condition, it is not the exclusive cause. Diabetes mellitus causes similar hepatic alterations: fat accumulation in hepatocytes, centroacinar fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrate by polymorphonuclear neutrophils and hyaline degeneration of perinuclear mallory. Taking this into consideration, we can rule out the second question (they are intracellular fat accumulations, not glycogen) and the fourth (if diabetes also produces this situation, there is no reason to mistrust the patient). Based on the primum non nocere and not having special relevance for the treatment if it is a focal or generalized disease, it is not necessary to repeat a liver biopsy that would not expand information, discarding the first question.

Urinalysis shows a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The electrocardiogram confirms a previously unknown AF. Blood biochemistry shows a Creat of 0.9, Ca of 11 and LDH of 950. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?",Plain abdominal x-ray.,Intravenous urography.,Spiral CT with contrast.,Abdominal ultrasound.,Doppler ultrasound.,3,single,"In principle, what you tell us does not fit with a nephritic colic. The urine is normal (without hematuria, caused by the lithiasis as it progresses), the Creat is normal (it can rise up to 1.9 in nephritic colic). The increase in LDH is non-specific and can be found in hepatic parenchymal lesions, AMI or pulmonary embolism, as well as in many other less frequent cases (tumors, myopathies, etc.). In this case, we have an important risk factor for embolism, which is atrial fibrillation, which, in addition, being a 45-year-old male, with no previous history, does not seem to respond to an underlying structural heart disease together with right lumbar pain, which could correspond to irritation of the pleura at the level of the right lumbar spine. Spiral CT with contrast has acquired great value in the diagnosis of PTE, due to its rapidity and good sensitivity, higher than 83-92% in most studies, and according to some it can reach 100% for central thrombi, located in main, lobar or segmental pulmonary arteries. Its specificity is greater than 90%. Nodes can produce false positives. It can also provide an alternative diagnosis in case PTE is not confirmed, so it would be a very useful test. Doppler ultrasound would be the most useful test to diagnose the source of the emboli, so it could also be a valid answer depending on what they mean by ""useful"". It is a noninvasive technique that has demonstrated its good sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of DVT compared to phlebography. It also allows the diagnosis of other pathologies that could justify the patient's symptoms.

To begin with, this is a patient with an extensive anterior and lateral AMI, with cardiogenic shock. On the other hand, in the history, we are told that the patient had a stroke 4 months ago. It is evident from the patient's clinical picture that an urgent reperfusion strategy is indicated, which invalidates options 4 and 5. The basic question is whether to choose fibrinolysis (which can be done in a regional hospital) or PCI (for which the patient should be referred to a tertiary center). Option 2 does not make much sense, since in the event that fibrinolysis is indicated, it would only be a waste of time to make the transfer. A history of stroke (presumably ischemic) 4 months ago is a relative contraindication for fibrinolysis (if the time is less than 3 months it is an absolute contraindication), but the definitive factor that tips the balance towards PCI is the extent of AMI and the presence of shock, which are indications for urgent PCI.

The separate findings are: normal pH but with alkalosis tendency, acute respiratory failure, hypocapnia and normal bicarbonate. The most appropriate answer seems to me to be 1, since the patient does not present a metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate would be higher), much less an acidosis (bicarbonate would be low).

This syndrome can be observed after surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), as well as in tertiary HPT of chronic renal failure, and to a lesser extent after treatment of processes with excess of circulating thyroid hormones (2). In PTH, there is an excess of parathyroid hormone (PTH) which stimulates osteoclastic activity causing demineralization of the bone matrix and releasing calcium into the bloodstream. After parathyroidectomy, serum PTH levels drop dramatically, thus, PTH-induced bone resorption ceases, while osteoblastic activity continues resulting in increased bone uptake of calcium, phosphate and magnesium, thus SHH appears (3).""",Medicine,

We can attack that question in two ways: by looking at the key data and going all the way to the diagnosis we are considering or by discarding one by one. The choluria, LDH, presence of panagglutinin and the peripheral blood smear ""smells"" like hemolytic anemia. Answer 1 cannot be because a marrow aplasia does not explain the choluria, the elevation of LDH, nor in the study of irregular antibodies is positive in the form of panagglutinin; an aplasia is a marrow failure characterized by a total or partial disappearance of hemopoietic progenitors. In addition, pancytopenia is not observed, which is what would incline us more towards this pathology. Answer 2 is not possible either, since a spherocytosis does not justify the presence of panagglutinin. Answer 3 is the one I consider correct: an autoimmune hemolytic anemia would justify the data given: elevated LDH and bilirubinemia due to red cell destruction, polychromatophilia, spherocytosis and anisocytosis because the marrow is working hard to try to compensate for the anemia, which is regenerative. The study of irregular antibodies and the presence of panagglutinin also supports this response, since the binding of an antibody to the hematocyte promotes its lysis and destruction. The girl presents cough and fever, consistent with a respiratory infection. And the initial treatment is corticosteroids. This is confirmed by Sans Sabrafens in his book ""Clinical Hematology"" [1]. Answer 4 gives rise to considerable doubt; it is not possible because a pernicious anemia does not justify the presence of panagglutinin although it would justify the elevation of LDH and bilirubin; moreover, it is an intramedullary, arregenerative hemolysis, there is no reticulocytosis or release into the blood of immature forms in an attempt to compensate and fix the situation.

On examination she found anesthesia to pain and temperature in both hands and distal forearms; positional and vibratory sensitivity were preserved. There is no muscle atrophy or strength deficit. Muscle reflexes are normal and symmetrical. There is no dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia or intention tremor. The rest of the neurological examination is strictly normal. Indicate the most likely diagnosis in this case:",Peripheral sensitvo symmetric distal peripheral neuropathy of diabetic cause.,Compressive cervical spinal cord injury.,Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.,Multiple sclerosis type demyelinating disease.,Central cervical spinal cord injury.,5,single,"This year's Neurology section's burning question. He presents a diabetic patient on insulin treatment with good control (although diabetic neuropathies do not only develop in patients with poor control) with a sensory picture limited to the upper limbs and of short onset time, without motor symptoms or at any other level. In the examination there is a clear dissociation with thermoalgesic anesthesia and preservation of arthrokinetic and vibratory. Reflexes are normal, neither abolished nor exalted. In addition, the rest of the examination is strictly normal. With all this I believe that the correct answer is 5, that is a syringomyelic lesion, whose initial characteristic is the sensitive dissociation with anesthesia for the thermoalgesic and conservation of the posterior cord. MS and other spinal cord lesions would be accompanied by other exploratory signs such as exaltation of reflexes, for carpal tunnel the exploration exceeds the territory distal to the carpus, and as for answer 1, although there are forms of peripheral polyneuropathy ""pseudosyringomyelic"" they are usually of lumbar onset. The short evolution time (2 weeks), the respect of the lower limbs and the preservation of muscle reflexes make me rule out this response despite the distribution being ""glove-like"".",Surgery,

Although she has been having similar episodes for more than a year, in the last 2 months they have worsened considerably. The pain is like a weight that starts in the occipital area, spreads to both temporal regions and is barely relieved by taking 650 mg paracetamol tablets, so she requests a CT scan (she is convinced that ""something must be wrong with her head""). Which of the following is the most plausible cause of her headache?",Migraine.,Vascular disorders.,Temporal artery arteritis.,Tension.,Oncologic.,4,single,"Just as last year they wanted to paint a nurse as bad for waking us up for a patient with myasthenia, this year they entertain us by presenting a patient asking for a CT scan. I interpret that they show a patient stressed by her children with recurrent headaches of occipital location that she previously relieved with a low dose of paracetamol and now she does not. Both the initially occipital location, the 2-year evolution time, and the sensation of weight lead to answer 4, a tension headache. Migraine and vascular disorders, accompanied by other neurological symptoms or nausea, photophobia, etc., are quickly ruled out, as well as the rare temporal arteritis before the age of 50 years.

Subsequently, he began with progressive deterioration of the level of consciousness and increase of Cr, LDH and unconjugated bilirubin. Direct Coombs' test was negative. Schistocytes in smear. In view of the diagnostic suspicion, the following conduct is to be followed:",New cranial CT in the presence of suspected hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke.,Initiate urgent plasmapheresis.,Beginning of treatment with glucocorticoids at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day.,Search for triggering cause of DIC.,Suspected multiple myeloma: bone marrow aspirate.,2,single,"Let's see: a patient with certain history who has: - Schistocytes in smear: indicates microangiopathic anemia, red cell rupture of mechanical cause, which can be seen mainly in PTT, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and DIC. - Bicytopenia: here the causes can be very, very varied. - Elevation of LDH and Bilirubin, which indicates a massive rupture of red blood cells. - Negative direct Coombs' test: essential data, indicating that there is no antibody that sticks to the red blood cells. With these wickers we are going to weave the basket: Answer 1: it cannot be because a hemorrhagic transformation does not give such a brutal elevation of LDH and Cr, in addition to not explaining schistocytosis. Answer 2: urgent plasmapheresis... in case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, yes; I like this answer because it justifies bicytopenia, since microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is produced by rupture of red blood cells when they are fragmented by ultralong von Willebrand factor multimers in case of deficiency of the ADAMST13 enzyme, resulting in brutal platelet aggregates and the flow cytometer does not count 400 platelets, but a molondron of platelets that form a mass, hence the thrombocytopenia. It also explains the negative direct Coombs, elevated LDH and Cr. Answer 3: a situation as critical as that patient's indicates that something big is going on and I would not sit and wait for glucocorticoids to take effect...and I do not know right now what pathology gives that symptomatology and has that treatment as standard. Answer 4: looking for a trigger for DIC...it would make sense if it were not for the fact that in DIC it is VERY characteristic the consumption of coagulation factors, which is not present in this case.

We could initially rule out central serous chorioretinopathy because by definition it occurs in young people (up to 55 years of age, more or less). The key to differentiate between the other four is that he had soft drusen in the fundus. That while not a ""diagnosis"" (the question could have been better worded) is a finding related to age-related macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration. The dry or atrophic form presents with slowly progressive visual loss. But the wet or exudative form produces acute or rapidly progressive severe visual loss (usually due to subretinal hemorrhage accompanied by metamorphopsia (image distortion due to retinal lifting). An epiretinal membrane usually has a slower course. In a macular hole, visual loss is more relevant (metamorphopsia may also be reported, but it is less likely in the acute stage). In thrombosis of the central retinal vein, visual loss is more important and does not usually explain metamorphopsia (but may have it, due to macular edema).",Ophthalmology,

Although in practice we should pay attention to the shape of the dendrite (the true dendrite is deeper and has terminal bulbs at the end of each branch), and pay attention to the evolution of the pain (in the pseudodendrite after abrasion the pain should improve), when answering a MIR question it is simpler: if it is a dendrite, the first thing we have to think is herpes.

Perhaps years ago before the osteoarthritis took place it would have been resolutive but not now (4 false). In addition, in order to consider an osteotomy, we should be given more data to know which bone to apply the osteotomy on, the tibia or the femur. Finally, we may think that it is best to first try rehabilitation before considering surgery, but I discard this option because the question emphasizes that we have exhausted pharmacological measures (although it could be considered because they have not specified whether it has been tried or not).

This picture should automatically lead us to mark epiphysiolysis capitis femoris (proximal femoral epiphysiolysis, the fact of reading it in Latin nomina is a bit of a misunderstanding but it should not mislead us). We should think of this one because it is the most frequent and possible (correct answer 2). The other options are not impossible but they are less frequent and they would not ask us this if they wanted us to choose another option. If they were sequelae of hip dysplasia, it would not have this 4-month onset and the age of onset would be earlier. Complications of dysplasia are dislocations and subluxations that may require surgery and avascular necrosis of the head (false answer 5). Perthes disease occurs in younger children (4-9 years) with episodes of limping and pain in the hip and knee (false answer 4). In a child the most typical would be a fracture at the level of the physis, not at the level of the femoral neck, so we discard 3. For us to consider this option we would have to have been presented with a bone cyst, something that would justify a weakness in the femoral neck area. As for juvenile chronic arthritis, it is a rheumatoid option surrounded by trauma options. They do not speak to us of rheumatologic factors in an analytical analysis, nor of a polyarticular picture. Perhaps we could think about this one because they talk about pain in the right knee, but this picture that they present us is limited to the right lower limb, they do not talk about other joints or fever or other accompanying systemic symptoms, so it is not an option to evaluate, especially with the other options presented to us that would be more likely in view of the picture presented to us (option 1 false).

Subcutaneous fat biopsy. Lupus erythematosus, some vasculitides, Goodpasture's disease and other systemic diseases (ankylosing spondylitis is one of them) affect the kidney and condition its prognosis. The appearance of urinary abnormalities or renal impairment of parenchymal cause are indications for renal biopsy, even with proteinuria ranges lower than those accepted in primary nephropathies. The determination of anti-GBM antibodies and ANCAS are helpful for diagnosis, but they do not replace renal biopsy, since they lack prognostic value and do not help to plan treatment. In this case, in which we are led to think that renal biopsy is not possible, we must relate AE to renal failure. In most cases, the relationship is established by an IgA nephropathy, which presents with hematuria, a symptom that claims not to exist in this case.

If the basal ACTH is low, he probably has a pituitary micro-adenoma, and a cranial CT scan should be performed.",3,single,"This question is a bit convoluted for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome but easy if the steps are clear. We all agree that the patient seems to have Cushing's syndrome (we rule out 1). For the diagnosis we have to measure urinary free cortisol, do a dexamethasone suppression test or measure nocturnal salivary cortisol. If hypercortisolism is confirmed, the origin should be sought; the ACTH measurement indicates the origin: suppressed in hypercortisolism of adrenal origin or prolonged use of corticoids and elevated or normal if the origin is pituitary or by ectopic ACTH secretion. (Therefore, 4 and 5 are false). If ACTH is low, a CT scan of the abdomen should be performed to locate the origin. If ACTH is normal or high, a pituitary MRI should be performed (pituitary adenomas responsible for Cushing's syndrome are very small and CT of the pituitary is less sensitive than MRI). It is very important to perform the order well to arrive at a proper diagnosis: 1st: confirm hypercortisolism or s. Cushing's syndrome, 2nd: measure ACTH to orient etiology. 3rd: imaging test according to ACTH levels. Therefore, answer 2 is false (abdominal CT is not a test to rule out s.

This leaves option 2 as true: as it has been previously said, the treatment would be performed combining corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis.",Medicine,

Considering that the individual has received some vaccines, has a CD4 count >100 (if lower there would be a contraindication) and works in a center that helps AIDS patients (he is equated to ""health personnel"") answers 2, 4 and 5 are wrong. All four vaccines in option 1 are administrable. In a little more detail: Vaccine against tetanus and diphtheria: all persons should be vaccinated against these two diseases. Hepatitis B vaccine: hepatitis B and HIV viruses share the same routes of transmission, so it is common for HIV-infected patients to also be infected with hepatitis B virus. It is therefore important to know whether the HIV-infected person has markers of hepatitis B infection and to proceed with vaccination if he/she does not have them. Vaccination against hepatitis A: Hepatitis A in a person with hepatitis B, hepatitis C or other liver disease can be very serious. Since these infections are more frequent in HIV-infected patients, vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended. Vaccination against influenza: influenza in a patient with a lack of immune response is more serious and presents a greater risk of complications, so annual vaccination against this disease is indicated. If the patient's immune status is very deteriorated, the response to vaccination is diminished. In this case, it is essential to vaccinate all the people living with the HIV-infected person to prevent them from transmitting the disease. Pneumococcal vaccine: pneumococcal infections (especially pneumonia) are up to 10 times more frequent in HIV-infected persons than in HIV-uninfected adults, so vaccination is recommended, although in patients with counts below 200/mm3 the protective response is usually not sufficient. They should receive a second dose at 3-5 years of age. HIV-infected children should be vaccinated with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with the corresponding number of doses according to age. Vaccination against Haemophilus Influenzae type b: this bacterium causes pneumonia and meningitis, especially in children. Although in HIV-infected adults it represents a small number of the causes of infection, vaccination is recommended. Vaccination against measles, rubella and mumps (MMR): all three diseases can become more serious in HIV-infected patients, especially measles, so all of them should be vaccinated, provided that immunosuppression is not severe (count less than 200/mm3).",Biochemistry,

Likewise, there are also no pauses longer than 3 seconds that could cause cardiogenic syncope (which, in fact, he has never suffered). Option 1 is ruled out: it is not a complete AVB. Option 2 cannot be answered either: to exclude, what is said to exclude... It is like never/always.

If we analyze the case carefully, the treatment should be effective since the germ is totally sensitive to the drug and the dosage is adequate (so that high concentrations of the drug should be maintained at all times, remember that the efficacy of beta-lactams is time-dependent and the antibiotic concentrations in blood should be above the MIC permanently to achieve effectiveness and avoid the production of resistance). In such a case, what could be happening, probably, although the antibiotic is the right one, it is not reaching the infectious focus adequately because an empyema has probably occurred. We should rule out the existence of an empyema and drain it while continuing with the antibiotic treatment. If the dosage had not been adequate and the presence of drug resistance was possible, one option could have been to treat with ceftriaxone at high doses, since we should remember that streptococcus does not produce beta-lactamase and beta-lactam resistance is produced by another mechanism (using amoxicillin-clavulanate would not provide us with anything). With quinolone we do not increase the spectrum and it is evident that the poor evolution of the patient is not only a problem of time.",Medicine,
2014-112,"A 20-year-old girl comes to the clinic with an acute fever, cervical lymphadenopathy and skin rash.

At first glance, we could directly rule out answer 2 since we know that mononucleosis can be an expression of the first phase of HIV infection, especially when we have a history of a risk contact. Answers 3 and 4 are also easily ruled out; ELISA is a very sensitive but not very specific technique and confirmation with a Western-blot test is ALWAYS necessary. Answers 1 and 5 contradict each other if you notice, so one of the two is correct. In this case, the false answer is 1, it is a very categorical answer (""rule out"") that does not quite fit the reality; As we have said, ELISA is a very sensitive technique, so a negative result could leave us quite calm, however, we all know that there is no medical test that rules out anything with total certainty (unless its sensitivity is 100%, which is not the case) and, on the other hand, we could say that in this case we have a high clinical suspicion (the picture is suggestive, and the antecedents are there). In addition, it is only 3 weeks since the contact, so our patient is probably in the ""window period"" during which serological techniques may be unprofitable. In conclusion, the answer that best fits us would be 5, in the window period a viral load may be indicated for diagnosis (positive if there are more than 10,000 copies), although this test is not done routinely.",Medicine,

The patient is a 16-year-old male who is admitted for a fairly clear case of mononucleosis due to EBV infection that becomes complicated during admission. The data available to us are: - Pancytopenia. - Hepatopathy. - Coagulopathy. - Absence of infectious focus: negative blood cultures, negative urine cultures, normal X-ray, normal CSF. - CRP and Ferritin elevated / normal Procalcitonin. The possible complications that could have occurred (and that are considered in the answers) are sepsis or a bad evolution of mononucleosis. The clinical data could be consistent with a septic process, however, the main infectious foci have been reasonably ruled out and one of the most sensitive and specific markers of bacteremia (procalcitonin) is in the normal range, which should draw our attention. On the other hand, a complication of the EBV mononucleosis suffered by our patient should be evaluated, among the possible complications are hemolytic anemia, meningoecephalitis (normal CSF) or Guillain-Barré sd. Guillain-Barré syndrome, which are not very consistent with the clinical picture presented to us. Another possible complication of exceptional severity would be hemophagocytic syndrome; this is a rare entity that occurs in certain predisposed subjects and is characterized by an uncontrolled activation and proliferation of histiocytes and T lymphocytes, which produces a state of hypercytokinemia.  The diagnostic criteria, revised in 2004, include persistent high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. Hyperferritinemia >3000 in a suggestive clinical context necessitates treatment of the patient (mainly with immunosuppressants and corticosteroids) since mortality is very high and early treatment is essential. The definitive diagnosis is made by microscopic study of an OM biopsy.  Although in this question they do not quantify the value of ferritinemia, it is a remarkable data and given that the clinical picture is suggestive, meeting the diagnostic criteria, it seems to me that answer 5 would be the most accurate.",Medicine,

When a diagnosis of active tuberculosis infection is made, treatment is initiated with isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide together with ethambutol in case of suspicion of strains resistant to any of the drugs. Once the existence of resistance has been ruled out, ethambutol can be dispensed with. In case of resistance to rifampicin, rifampicin is withdrawn and treatment is completed with the 3 remaining drugs for 12 months. The option of adding a quinolone during the first two months of treatment (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) is considered in cases of extensive pulmonary involvement. In this case, they do not tell us anything about extensive pulmonary involvement but they give us a data ""excessive alcohol consumption"". You know that in the MIR no data is free, and if the person who posted this question wanted to reflect it, probably his intention was that we reflect on it. Alcohol exerts a direct immunosuppressive effect, moreover, alcoholism is related to the affectation of immunity in the respiratory tract.

Here we already have the two keys; we have to suspect what is not mentioned in the answers, but which is what the child has: the shaken baby syndrome (shaken baby syndrome). Characteristic of this syndrome are bilateral retinal hemorrhages, cerebral edema and subdural hematoma. There may also be fracture of long bones and other problems. Numbness and hypotonia allow us to suspect intracranial complications. The cause of shaken baby syndrome is almost always abuse, so the answer is 1. Options 2 and 3 are easy to rule out: nothing indicates perforating trauma, and it does not explain the hemorrhages in the other eye. And the berlin edema is an edema of the macula and appears as a whitish lesion, which is not described in the statement. The catch is option 4. Purstcher's retinopathy can also appear in the context of the child of the shaken child, and therefore occur in the case of child abuse. Seeing these two partly related questions, we may hesitate. However, if we read answer 4 carefully, it does not tell us that if there is child maltreatment Purstcher can occur. It states that the picture described above (intraretinal hemorrhages, without other findings) is characteristic of Purstcher's angiopathy. It is not. In Purstcher's there are hemorrhages, but also cottony exudates and edema. If there are only hemorrhages, it's not Purstcher's. Here's the messy bit, but it's really well worded. If he had a Purstcher it could also be for child abuse, but he doesn't.",Ophthalmology,

As this is a situation of oligometastasis and the treatments for advanced colon adenocarcinoma allow prolonged survival with good quality of life in these patients, if there is nothing to contraindicate surgery, this should be the first option (correct answer 3). I attach the algorithm proposed by the NCCN in situations of recurrence (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/colon.pdf). In case of an unresectable situation, chemotherapy treatment would be considered with the intention of converting the single metastatic lesion into a resectable one. Since more than 12 months have passed since FOLFOX treatment, the same scheme could be used, although FOLFIRI+bevacizumab would also be useful. Capecitabine monotherapy, in the patient's current situation, would also not be a good starting option, since the responses are lower compared to FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus antiangiogenic combinations.

The best value of the examination is taken because in many cases (assessment of a polytraumatized patient, ischemic stroke or spontaneous acute cerebral bleeding), the motor examination may be artifacted by other elements. For example: in a polytraumatized patient (such as the one in question), the response presented with left extremities may be due to localized trauma in that area, and not strictly speaking to an underlying traumatic brain injury. Likewise, sometimes the verbal response may be underestimated in the polytraumatized patient due to airway obstruction (e.g., due to the tongue retreating into the oropharynx). By always assessing the best response, we will have a truer picture of the patient's condition.",Preventive & Social Medicine (PSM),
2021-101,"15-year-old male, admitted after being run over on the public road, resulting in being ejected. He was admitted conscious and oriented, with intense pain in the left hemithorax and dyspnea. Physical examination showed blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, heart rate 130 bpm, basal oxygen saturation 90%, respiratory rate 35 rpm. There is complete hypophonesis in the left hemithorax and dullness to percussion. Chest X-ray shows multiple left costal fractures and massive ipsilateral pleural effusion. Placement of a pleural drain is indicated, with 1700 cc of hematic fluid coming out. What is the decision to be made:",Institute noninvasive mechanical ventilation and request blood transfusion.,"Analgesia, oxygen therapy, request blood transfusion and indicate urgent surgery.","Orotracheal intubation, request blood transfusion and observation for, in case of worsening, indicate surgical intervention.",Orotracheal intubation and urgent CT scan for accurate assessment of lesions.,,2,single,"There are two answers that we can immediately rule out if we stick to the initial management of severe chest trauma: 1 (noninvasive ventilation is not indicated because it does not secure the airway) and 3 (observation in these cases, waiting for worsening, only leads to increased morbidity and mortality). Between options 2 and 4 there could be controversy between the literature and the usual clinical practice, in which we usually have to face in a delicate balance the clinical stability of the patient (and what we can ""make up"" this stability with our life support therapies) and the actions that result in better patient care for the definitive treatment of the lesions. We are dealing with a severe polytraumatized patient. With the data provided by the question, a patient who seems to be in shock (tachycardia, hypoxemia, tachypnea... although we do not receive data, for example, on lactacidemia), and in whom we have to our knowledge a left thoracic trauma, which not only implies bone injury, but may mask other injuries of high severity and which are not diagnosed with a chest X-ray: myocardial contusion, pericardial effusion, splenic injury, diaphragmatic injury... We place a left pleural drain on the patient and obtain a debit of 1700cc of hematic fluid. If we follow the ATLS (ATLS-Advanced Trauma Life Support 10th edition) guidelines for the care of severely polytraumatized patients, they tell us that an immediate bleeding of more than 1500cc of blood is an indication for urgent thoracotomy, and that even in patients with a bleeding of less than 1500cc, if the debit persists at a rate of 200mL/h for 2 to 4h, this indication would also exist. Therefore, the person who asked the MIR question wants us to answer option 2. However, in real life, the course of action will depend on the stability of the patient when we have applied the treatments indicated in option 2: adequate analgesia, oxygen therapy and initiation of blood transfusion. If by optimizing the patient we manage to stabilize him and assess that it is safe to transfer him, the performance of a body CT scan will define in much greater detail the lesions he has, and will help to ensure that the surgery he will probably end up undergoing will be a definitive surgery and not just damage control surgery. In this case, the doubt would arise with option 4, although, as I say, everything will depend on the clinical stability of the patient and the time we have before achieving definitive control of the hemorrhagic focus (which is, after all, what we are after in this situation).",Preventive & Social Medicine (PSM),

With natremia above 125 mmol/l it is not indicated to treat with HSS unless the patient has severe neurological symptoms, which does not seem to be the case (they describe a confusional picture that would be a moderate hyponatremic encephalopathy), and it is not indicated to restore natremia as soon as possible (due to the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome).

What I do not like about this answer is that the second part (""if natraemia does not rise, switch to slow infusion of saline"") is incorrect, since in this case the use of furosemide, tolvaptan or urea should be considered, not saline (and it does not indicate tonicity either, since isotonic is not the same as hypertonic).

2022-63,A 36-year-old male consults for conjunctival hyperemia and foreign body sensation. Which of the following pathologies does NOT correspond to the above mentioned examination?,Adenoviral conjunctivitis.,Allergic conjunctivitis.,Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome.,Chlamydia conjunctivitis.,,2,single,"The involvement of the preauricular node is the typical lymphadenopathy of conjunctival infectious conditions. It is true that typical bacterial conjunctivitis does not usually present with lymphadenopathy. They have a more rapid and self-resolving course and do not awaken the lymphoid response as adenoviruses typically do. Or some more atypical bacteria that produce chronic conjunctivitis, such as Chlamydia, or much more infrequent bacteria such as those responsible for Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome (Bartonella henselae, Francisella tularensis, Sporothrix schenckii, etc). Adenopathy being very typical of adenoviral conjunctivitis, this option is the easiest to rule out. Considering that chlamydiae arouse the lymphoid response in a similar way to adenoviruses (they also produce conjunctival follicles, for example), this would be the second easiest option to rule out. Perhaps the difficult thing is to rule out oculoglandular syndrome of Parinaud, because it is a very rare disease. If we do not realize that it is an infectious disease, we could hesitate. In any case, allergic conjunctivitis is not an infectious problem. So it is not going to have adenopathy. Even if we doubt with some of the previous options (especially with Parinaud), if we stay with the basic concepts (allergic conjunctivitis does not present with lymphadenopathies) we can be right. Option 2 is the correct one.",Ophthalmology,
2022-64,A 68-year-old woman who uses +4.00 diopter glasses for distance vision in both eyes. She consults because she has been having eye pain with headache and blurred vision at night when she is watching television in dim light for a few weeks. Which of the following pathologies is she most likely to have?,Primary angular closure glaucoma.,Migraine.,Actinic keratitis.,Dry eye syndrome.,,1,single,"We are presented with a 68-year-old female patient. At that age the crystalline lens, although it does not normally have a cataract that needs surgery, it usually has increased in thickness. This implies that it projects the iris forward and reduces the depth of the anterior chamber. In an eye with a normal anterior chamber depth this is usually not a problem. But farsighted people already have a narrow anterior chamber. This is the usual combination we find in primary angular closure: farsightedness and age over 50-60 years. Younger hyperopes usually do not have this problem yet. And neither do older people who are emmetropic, myopic or have had cataract surgery. With this narrow angle, what triggers angular closure is mydriasis. That is, when you are in the penumbra, the pupil dilates and the iris thickens in the peripheral part, where it is already very close to the corneal endothelium in the case of a narrow chamber. Mydriasis then triggers angular closure, which is accompanied by ocular pain that may radiate backwards (headache). And increased intraocular pressure produces corneal edema that causes blurred vision. Therefore, option 1 is correct. Migraine does not have to be related to penumbra, and ocular pain and blurred vision is not particularly typical. Actinic keratitis is caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation (such as solar radiation), and is not related to hyperopia or to being in penumbra. In addition, the history of exposure is usually clear. And finally, dry eye does not produce these symptoms either: it is more a question of burning, foreign body sensation, heaviness, etc. And it is also unrelated to the other elements: penumbra, hyperopia, etc. As a minor detail, I would have worded the question a little better. It is understood that we are asked which pathology is the most probable in relation to the symptoms and the anamnesis. But as it is worded, we are asked about which of the pathologies she is most likely to present, just like that. Actually, a 68-year-old woman is very likely to have dry eye, even if it does not cause the symptoms for which she is presenting.",Ophthalmology,

2022-121,"79-year-old woman admitted for an osteoporotic hip fracture. Regarding secondary prevention of fragility fractures, point out the WRONG answer:",Low adherence to treatment is associated with an increased risk of fracture.,Bone remodeling markers may be useful for early monitoring of response to treatment.,Vitamin D monotherapy is effective in reducing such fractures in non-institutionalized elderly.,Increasing dietary calcium or taking calcium supplements alone does not protect against the occurrence of fractures.,,3,single,"This question corresponds to the section on traumatology; however, it could be answered with knowledge of rheumatology and with the osteoporosis recommendations of the Spanish Society of Rheumatology. In osteoporosis, one of the main risks associated with increased fracture risk is low adherence to treatment, so answer 1 is correct. Answer 2 is found in the SER guidelines, which confirm that some studies conclude that bone remodeling markers can be useful for early monitoring of adherence and response to treatment. Answer 4 is correct because again in the SER 2019 guidelines they quote: ""The current scientific evidence allows us to affirm that neither increasing dietary calcium nor taking calcium supplements alone protects against the appearance of fractures"". Therefore, the correct answer to this question is option 3. Patients on pharmacological treatment for OP should use calcium and vitamin D supplements because practically all clinical trials that have demonstrated efficacy of antiosteoporotic drugs routinely include calcium supplements and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), but not in monotherapy.",Medicine,

Temporomandibular ankylosis is not considered because, although relatively close to the orbital cavity, it is not part of the orbito-malar complex (option 1 discarded).
